# Car.com-Web-Scraping-Project
This is an open-source web-scraping project, where I used the beautiful soup library in python to extract the following details from the cars.com website: Name Mileage Price  Rating Rating_count Dealer Name Single page scraping: As regards scraping, I extracted the information above from 20 cars on the first page of the website and then extracted the details above and parsed them into an excel file.  Multi-page scraping:  For scraping the same details for multiple pages, I have developed a slightly modified crawler that goes through each page (through the first 10 pages), finds the details we need and extracts them into our data frame.
